# Educational-Institutions

This project is defined as an application based on the Internet that aims to all the levels of management providing information within an organization as well as publicly. This system can be used as an information management system for the college. The design and implementation of a comprehensive Online College Management System and user interface are to replace the current paper records. College Staff can directly access all aspects of a student’s academic progress through a secure, online interface embedded in the college’s website. Our Project is going to touch some of the other topics also such as like:

⮚ ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)

⮚ Database Management system
